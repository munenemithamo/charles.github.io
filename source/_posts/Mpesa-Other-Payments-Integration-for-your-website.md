***With the new era of mobile money transfer and the ease it has brought about in doing business, it is very clear that MPESA is not going anywhere anytime soon.***

*It is a fact that Kenya is quickly joining the global cashless economy. And while the west managed this through the use of credit and debit cards, in Kenya the cashless economy is run through mobile transfers and more specifically, through Mpesa.*

```Today, it is becoming more common for people to carry less cash and rely solely on mobile transfers from their bank accounts to business transactions and even utility payments. From supermarket payments, to food payments in restaurants and eventually to transport, more and more transactions are relying less on tangible bank notes and more on mobile phones.```


***Why you should care about Integrating your payment solutions.***

*It is every businessâ€™s goal to not only get paid, but to get paid well. However, if you are spending time manually reconciling and entering accounting data, chances of error are very high.*

```Integrated payment solutions are tools that your business can use to combine your accounting, customer relationship management systems and other applications you may be using together with payment processes. By doing this, you not only save time and money, but It enables you to have a better view and understanding of your business financially.```

*The truth is, every time a business accepts money, there are costs. Tracking these costs from different payment solutions may be a bit hard and lead to many errors and waste of time. By integrating your payments solutions, you automate the tracking and reconciling tasks in all your business systems making it all work together to deliver a seamless system that ensures accuracy and saves time.*

```When choosing a payment integration solution, a business needs to consider where their highest transaction volumes come from, what business applications you need to integrate with payment, e.g accounting, sales etc, and what level of integration your business needs, e.g. do you need it to authorize, accept, decline, store client information, send notifications or print receipts among other tasks.```

>Once you have figured out these questions then you are ready to choose what integration solution you will need for your business. Also, if you are a business in Kenya, the solution for you will most likely involve Mpesa.
