**This section is for my fellow Web Developers and it's still in active development stage. It's an eCommerce page that will contain all the favorite Web Development Ebooks.**

*According to what I've experienced through my web dev journey, **one good book is worth a thousand videos.***

`A book will often go deep into details further than any video you'll ever come across, and apparently, programming is hard. You will need even those tiny details to connect the dots to see the bigger picture to understand coding comprehensively.`
