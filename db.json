Getting those visitors to follow you on social media is a great way to stay relevant to these potential prospects.</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/consulenza-sui-social-media.png\"></p>\n<p><em><strong>4.It Enhances Your User Experience.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>When a prospective customer is able to see the level of transparency you have incorporated into the website through social media integration, they will view you more positively as a business.</em></p>\n<p><code>Even the smallest convenience like social login can have a positive impact on the user experience and make them more likely to convert.</code></p>\n<p><em><strong>5.Social Media Integration adds Social Proof to Your Website.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Social proof is a form of social influence wherein people copy the actions of others.</em><br><em>Integrating your social media accounts onto your website displays the number of followers you have. This can build credibility and inspire others to do the same.</em></p>\n<p><code>The more positive the reaction is to your business, the greater the trust you’re able to garner from website visitors.</code></p>\n<p><strong>How to Integrate Social Media into your Website.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Now that you understand the importance of integrating social media into your website, you may decide that social media integration is something that you would like to pursue. Below you will find a list of ways that you can do so.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>1.Add Social Media Buttons to Your Website.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>At the most basic level, if you’re utilizing any social media platform to market your business, the first step to website social media integration should be to add social media buttons for the platforms you’re on. This will make it easy for website visitors to find and connect with you on the platforms they use. In addition, it’s convenient because site visitors are able to access your social profile through a single click.</em></p>\n<p><code>A great place to add your social media buttons is towards the bottom of your website homepage and towards the top or at the end of blog posts or the side bar. To make your buttons stand out, feel free to customize the colors using your brand colors.</code></p>\n<p><em><strong>2.Make it Easy for Visitors to Sign up with Social Login.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>When you incorporate social login into your website, you are providing potential customers with the option of logging into the website through their social media platform that is synced to their computers, tablets or mobiles. This eliminates the need for your website visitors to create a username and password when signing up or checking out, making the process more efficient.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not only is this more convenient but it is also highly beneficial for your business. You will be able to collect more accurate data on your website users such as email address, age, gender and interest and most importantly reduce spam.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>3.Increase Visitor Engagement with Social Media-Based Commenting.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Social Media Commenting allows website visitors to comment on your blog or forums by logging in with their social media accounts. By implementing social media-based commenting you can eliminate spam comments on your website.</em></p>\n<p><code>Social media commenting can also provide additional benefits. For example, the comments on your blog can be a huge benefit for SEO as they count towards the word count for that page, if the comments are genuine and of high quality. In addition, blogs that have comments show engagement and encourage others to participate as well, demonstrating the value of your content.</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/social-media-icons.jpg\"></p>\n<p><em><strong>4.Get visitors to Share &amp; Save Your Products Through Social Integration on Product Pages.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>A product page is a page on an eCommerce website designed to sell your products. It provides a description of that product in its entirety, including the features and benefits. Through the integration of social media on your product pages you encourage others to share your products, increasing word of mouth. In addition, for those who view your product page and don’t buy, you provide them the opportunity to save your product and easily return to it later.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Should you decide to integrate social media on your product pages, ensure that it is not the main focus and doesn’t distract from your main call to action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>5.Increase Connections with Social Media Integration on Your About Us Page.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Your website ‘about us’ page is a great place for visitors to learn more about the people behind the company, your values and your mission. It’s also a great place for you to integrate social media such as asking visitors to connect with you on LinkedIn or learn more about your experience via your LinkedIn profile. This helps to increase your connections and start building a real relationship with prospects and customers alike.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>6.Make Your Social Media Posts More Visible with Open Graphs and Twitter Cards.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Have you ever shared a link to a product, article or blog post on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter and noticed that an image appears along with a headline and description? The ability for this to occur is powered by Open Graphs and Twitter Cards tags. Without implementing this on your website, content shared from your website would simply be text-based and not as attractive or eye-catching.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Open Graphs and Twitter Cards are designed to help communicate information on the content shared to the different social networks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>7.Use Social Analytics Integration to Bolster Your Marketing Campaigns.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Through the integration of social media analytics tools such as the Facebook Pixel and LinkedIn Insights Tag, both of which are free to integrate, you can gather data to help improve your marketing campaigns. For example, once the LinkedIn Insights Tag is installed, you can get access to data such as the job titles and company names of the people who visit your website and much more.</em></p>\n<p><code>With the Facebook Pixel, you can segment your traffic based on visitors to specific pages of your website for the purpose of retargeting to that audience – a practice that can increase lead generation and sales.</code></p>\n<p><strong>Social Media Integration Mistakes to Avoid.</strong></p>\n<p><em>While incorporating social media into your website is important, the quality with which the task is done is equally as valuable. Here are some website social media integration mistakes to avoid.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Placing your social media icons at the top of your website so that any and all traffic is redirected from it.</li>\n<li>Not customizing the social media icons to match your website’s brand and personality.</li>\n<li>Linking your website to inactive social media accounts that have no value for prospective customers.</li>\n<li>Linking to Social sharing buttons that show low sharing numbers, which can adversely affect your credibility.</li>\n<li>Using plugins that have heavy JavaScript files, which extend the loading time of the page and can lead to website abandonment issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Taking steps to implement the correct social media tactics can have a positive impact on your ability to expand your reach, build a relationship with your audience and experience a positive ROI on your marketing efforts. <a href=\"mailto:munenemithamo@gmail.com?subject=I%20NEED%20A%20WEBSITE%20NOW.&body=Hi%20Charles,\">Get in touch</a> today to get social media integration in your website at the most affordable rates and stay connected with your customers.</p>\n</blockquote>"},{"title":"Web Consultancy & Tech Support for your business.","date":"2024-05-25T13:41:56.000Z","_content":"![](/images/What-is-technical-support-in-call-center-featured-image.png)\n>In today’s digital world, businesses can no longer afford to operate without efficient IT support.\n\n```Infact, many companies now consider effective IT support as a key factor that can drive their organization forward and help them achieve their business objectives faster.```\n\n*Whether you are looking to grow your business and get new customers, or simply want to streamline processes and cut down costs, investing in an efficient IT system is imperative for any company.*\n<!-- more -->\n```Unfortunately, when a business owner starts a new venture, their initial focus is on getting it off the ground and keeping it running day-to-day.```\n\n*Yet, as every business owner knows, things don’t always go smoothly.

E-Commerce helps you reduce your costs.***\n\n*It is not required to display all of your products in a physical location in order to establish an online business. In fact, there are numerous online businesses that only display their entire inventory on their e-commerce platform.*\n\n```This includes saving on everything that needs energy, the Internet, etc., in addition you don’t need to rent or buy a space. It does not have to be as big as everything you sell if you only want to have one so that customers have a real place. You will be cutting your expenses in both scenarios.```\n\n***2. E-Commerce helps businesses go global.***\n\n*This feature, which is directly related to the preceding point, enables you to sell your goods anywhere in the world. They won't feel the need to travel to your location only to view what you have to offer.*\n\n>With a physical location, your reach will be constrained by the area you can serve, but having an e-Commerce website will allow you to reach a wider audience. Customers from all around the world will be able to purchase your goods and services through it, regardless of location or time zone.\n\n*Additionally, this removes all kinds of linguistic and geographic restrictions. They will be able to purchase from other countries thanks to your e-commerce being translated into several languages.*\n\n```The entire world is your playground if you use e-Commerce and mobile commerce. Many clients who might be seated in another part of the world are able to access your goods or services.```\n\n>So, starting your own online store and localising it in other languages is a terrific idea if you want to expand your online business internationally.\n\n***3. E-Commerce can be done with fewer overheads & fewer risk.***\n\n```Compared to opening a brick-and-mortar store, starting an internet business might result in much reduced startup costs. The owner of an internet business does not have to account for the expensive costs of shop rental, hiring a salesperson to win over customers, power costs, security measures, etc.```\n\n*You'll then be able to price your goods competitively as a result. Also, having an internet store gives you the opportunity to benefit more while taking on less risk.*\n\n![](/images/ecommerce-768x402.jpg)\n\n***4. E-Commerce can broaden your brand & expand your business.***\n\n*Having an e-commerce site can help you grow your business, attract more consumers, and diversify your revenue streams by allowing you to sell a wider variety of goods and services. It's the best approach to transform your brand from a conventional brick-and-mortar business to a cutting-edge, well-known one.*\n\n```With e-commerce, you don't need to have more than one branch; instead, you can reach all of your consumers from a single online store without worrying about changing locations. You can even run your online business from home.```\n\n>It's vital to note that e-commerce will help both B2C and B2B companies increase brand recognition in the marketplace.\n\n***5. Your online store will stay open 24/7/365.***\n\n*Also, one of the major benefits of e-commerce that businesses who sell online can take advantage of is that their store hours are now 24/7/365 rather than the traditional 8-5 hours that ordinary stores are open.*\n\n```Retailers can enhance their order volume in this way to increase sales. Customers can buy goods and services whenever they want, whether it is late at night or early in the morning, which is useful.```\n\n***6. Personalise your shopping experience.***\n\n*Knowing (and being able to watch) what your customers do is one of the obvious benefits of having an online store. It would be physically uncomfortable for a potential customer to approach your store if you were always behind him, enquiring about his needs or the reasons why he was choosing not to purchase your product.*\n\n>By sending an email, you can use e-commerce, for instance, to track where in the process a purchase was left and even to keep track of it.\n\n```Also, this can make consumers have a better purchasing experience on a subsequent occasion by streamlining the order process or providing the customer with goods that share some of their preferences.```\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n```You offer customers a lot of convenience and value if you have an e-commerce store. Creating your e-commerce website is a crucial part of your business. It is an excellent strategy for establishing your brand, attracting more loyal customers, learning new things, and honing your marketing inventiveness.```\n\n>[Get in touch](mailto:munenemithamo@gmail.com?subject=I%20NEED%20A%20WEBSITE%20NOW.&body=Hi%20Charles,) today to get an e-commerce site up and running in no time and sell your products and services conveniently to the global market at a pocket-friendly cost.\n\n\n\n\n","source":"_posts/eCommerce-is-key-to-any-business-financial-success.md","raw":"---\ntitle: E-Commerce is Key to any business success.\ndate: 2024-05-25 17:34:48\ntags: eCommerce\n---\n![](/images/eCommerce-websites-in-kenya.jpg)\n\n```E-commerce presents business owners with a fantastic opportunity to grow their company and achieve success.

Let's look at 10 significant benefits of SEO for your business, and how you can realize them.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n**1. It Boosts Your Credibility.**\n\n```A site that ranks high on search engine results pages is typically considered high-quality and trustworthy by search engines, and this, in turn, boosts the credibility of your business. Spend time improving and adding content to your site, increasing your site speed and researching keywords to help your site rank even higher.```\n\n**2. It Doesn't Have To Cost You Anything.**\n\n*Apart from time if you handle it yourself, SEO does not cost anything like other marketing strategies such as pay-per-click. Search engines crawl your site 24/7, promoting useful content and helping you find new customers organically. To make the most of your SEO efforts, allocate some of your time to reviewing the content on higher ranking sites within your niche, and aim to write content that's better than theirs. Then, share your content on your social platforms.*\n\n**3. It Supports Content Marketing.**\n\n```Original content and SEO work hand in hand; by creating helpful content for visitors, including text, images and videos, your site will rank better in search results. But SEO can support your content marketing efforts too. Make sure that your content is high quality and optimized for keywords you want to rank for, and since search engines like freshness, update your content regularly.```\n\n**4. It Maximizes PPC Campaigns.**\n\n*Unpaid (SEO) and paid marketing strategies (PPC) work fantastically well together. PPC helps your site appear at the top of paid search results, while SEO does the same thing organically. Having both results appear at the top of the search engine results page boosts your brand's credibility and shows that you are not merely throwing money at advertising to be on top. You can use SEO to maximize your PPC campaigns — for example, a high-ranking page may do even better if you use it as part of PPC advertising, especially if the keyword has a low cost-per-click.*\n\n![](/images/bigstock-Seo-optimization-Concept-Seo-387094645.jpg.webp.webp)\n\n**5. It Gives You A Competitive Advantage.**\n\n```Your competitors will likely be investing in SEO, which means you should too. Those who invest heavily in SEO often outrank the competition in search engine results and gain market share. If you consider that results on the first page of a Google search get over 90% of traffic, you cannot afford not to be there, especially if your competitors are. Start by identifying your competitors, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and creating and managing your online reputation. Then, ensure that your site loads fast and is mobile-friendly, make the best content possible, and focus on providing the best user experience.```\n\n**6. It Can Help You Reach More People.**\n\n*While many marketing campaigns tend to focus on a defined target audience, SEO can help you attract anyone with intent at a given point in time, no matter what stage of the buying funnel they are in. If you target keywords rather than demographics as you might with PPC or social advertising, you can attract more prospects who may be interested in doing business with you.*\n\n>Create a list of keywords you would like to rank for. Then, use keyword research tools to expand it. Finally, use competitive research to refine your list by identifying who your competitors are, what keywords they are ranking for and where they have backlinks, and use this information to create a better SEO strategy.\n\n**7. It Helps You Rank Better In Local Searches.**\n\n```Local searches such as \"plumbers near me\" are becoming more common. And nearly 80% of local searches on mobile lead to conversions. Local SEO strategies can help you attract these searchers who are often ready to buy. The first step to getting started with local SEO strategies is creating a Google My Business account. Then, start requesting reviews from your clients.``` \n\n*Optimize your listings by ensuring that you have the correct name, address and phone number. Also be sure to optimize your listing for voice search, which means writing rich, compelling content in a conversational tone that answers most common queries and provides solutions to searchers' problems. Some other steps include carefully considering your local keywords and creating listings in local business directories.*\n\n![](/images/lappy.jpg)\n\n**8. It Improves Website Usability.**\n\n```SEO is about making your site search engine-friendly, but it also can improve the experience a customer has when visiting your website. If you put the work in to generate useful and high-quality content, make your site faster and more responsive, add backlinks and enhance every page, you typically get an excellent website in addition to one that's optimized for search engines. Factors that improve usability include a robust site structure and navigation, both of which are factors in how search engines rank a site.```\n\n**9.

Platforms like Google Analytics provide a comprehensive suite of information, allowing you to drill down to an incredibly granular level. For example, you can see every website user's buying journey — including the pages they engaged with, the keywords they used to search and whether they completed specific actions. You can use these insights to adjust and improve your SEO strategy.*\n\n**10. It Improves User Engagement Rates.**\n\n```An optimized site brings in quality traffic. If you have a site with useful content that matches the searcher's intent, they will likely spend more time browsing, which ultimately can lead to more conversions and increased ROI. Customers who engage longer with a website tend to connect to the brand more — this can lead to customer advocacy and long-term revenue. To improve your user engagement rate, use one of the many online tools to audit your site, and then optimize things like your title and meta tags. Also, ensure that you're providing a safe and mobile-friendly website.```\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n>SEO has major benefits for websites and can lead to long-term exponential growth.

It Boosts Your Credibility.</strong></p>\n<p><code>A site that ranks high on search engine results pages is typically considered high-quality and trustworthy by search engines, and this, in turn, boosts the credibility of your business. Spend time improving and adding content to your site, increasing your site speed and researching keywords to help your site rank even higher.</code></p>\n<p><strong>2. It Doesn’t Have To Cost You Anything.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Apart from time if you handle it yourself, SEO does not cost anything like other marketing strategies such as pay-per-click. Search engines crawl your site 24&#x2F;7, promoting useful content and helping you find new customers organically. To make the most of your SEO efforts, allocate some of your time to reviewing the content on higher ranking sites within your niche, and aim to write content that’s better than theirs. Then, share your content on your social platforms.</em></p>\n<p><strong>3. It Supports Content Marketing.</strong></p>\n<p><code>Original content and SEO work hand in hand; by creating helpful content for visitors, including text, images and videos, your site will rank better in search results. But SEO can support your content marketing efforts too. Make sure that your content is high quality and optimized for keywords you want to rank for, and since search engines like freshness, update your content regularly.</code></p>\n<p><strong>4. It Maximizes PPC Campaigns.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Unpaid (SEO) and paid marketing strategies (PPC) work fantastically well together.

You can use SEO to maximize your PPC campaigns — for example, a high-ranking page may do even better if you use it as part of PPC advertising, especially if the keyword has a low cost-per-click.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/bigstock-Seo-optimization-Concept-Seo-387094645.jpg.webp.webp\"></p>\n<p><strong>5.

Then, ensure that your site loads fast and is mobile-friendly, make the best content possible, and focus on providing the best user experience.</code></p>\n<p><strong>6. It Can Help You Reach More People.</strong></p>\n<p><em>While many marketing campaigns tend to focus on a defined target audience, SEO can help you attract anyone with intent at a given point in time, no matter what stage of the buying funnel they are in.
